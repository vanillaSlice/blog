*tl;dr: Keeping your pull requests small will lead to quicker and better quality reviews, allowing you to
merge your glorious code into master much sooner.*

*Disclaimer: Many of the behaviours described in this post have been exhibited by myself. I am not directing criticisms
towards anyone in particular.*

## Storytime

Picture this. You've just arrived at work. It's a beautiful day, the sun is shining (not that you'll be seeing any of it
you hermit you ðŸ˜‰). You're raring to code. You switch on your laptop and grab a cup of coffee. You reply to a few emails
and see that you, *yes you*, have been hand-selected to review a pull request. Positively flattered, you open it up
only to be hit by a wall of red and green. You think, "what is this Lovecraftian-sized beast that stands before me?". A
changeset so big that you could develop RSI just by scrolling through it. Lucky for you, there are multiple requested
reviewers. So you close the tab and forget about it.

20 minutes laterâ€¦

You've been sucked right back in. There's no escaping this now.

Headphones? Check. More coffee? Check. A copious number of biscuits? Check.

You open the PR again.

The summary stares back at you. Taunting you:

As you scroll through, you realise that despite what the description says, this PR doesn't just add a new
feature. There are refactorings, renamings, deleted files, reformattings, import reorderings, dependency upgrades, fixed
typos, dead code removal and, finally, new code. And not just new code. A *lot* of new code. New code that could have
been submitted independently in bite-sized chunks.

You spend the next 25 minutes going over the changes, trying to understand how all of this works whilst ducking and
weaving through superfluous updates. You gloss over certain parts (because life is too short). You leave a few
suggestions. There's a bit of back and forth between you and the author. The code generally looks pretty good. And
with that, you bestow the honour of a pull request approval. You're free at last. The monster is slain!

1 hour laterâ€¦

You take a look at this new PR. You are overcome with joy and relief when you see:

![Screenshot 4](/images/keep-those-prs-small/screenshot-4.png)

It's a fraction of the size of the previous PR. It's to the point. It's a bug fix and *only* a bug fix. Nothing more.
Nothing less. You see what the problem originally was and how this PR fixes it. You understand it perfectly. You see
how all the unit tests cover each edge case and will stop this bug from rearing its ugly head in the future. Reviewing
this PR is a doddle and you submit your approval in no time.

But you're left with an underlying feeling of disappointment. Disappointed that neither you nor the author spotted this
bug in the original PR. It was glaringly obvious (albeit surrounded by a bazillion other changes). Maybe it was just a
one-off.

30 minutes laterâ€¦

â€¦of course, it wasn't a one-off. There is rarely just one bug.

And so on and so on.

Now, this may be slightly exaggerated but I'm sure most of you have been in similar situations (having played both
characters). I'm using this as a way to illustrate why I believe that keeping your PRs small will lead to faster and
better quality reviews.

## So what is a "Small PR"?

For me, pull requests should do one thing. Let me paraphrase the advice in
[Clean Code](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/clean-code/9780136083238/) on functions:

> Pull requests should do one thing. They should do it well. They should do it only.

Every line in your PR should contribute to that one thing. Anything that does not contribute to that one thing should be
put on a separate PR.

* Mixing bug fixes and new features? **Put them on separate PRs.**
* Moving those classes that we aren't using to a new package? **Put them on a separate PR.**
* Those refactorings that have no relevance to this new feature? **Put them on a separate PR.**
* Deleting old files that haven't been needed for the past 3 years? **Put it on a separate PR.**
* Writing two services that are completely independent of each other? **Put them on separate PRs.**

Choosing to do one thing in your PRs will naturally make them more focused and smaller (and reviewers will adore you
for it!).

## The Good

So why on earth should we go to the effort of making smaller PRs? Here are some advantages I've observed:

### More likely to review
### Quicker reviews/More digestible
### Easier to spot problems
### Constantly merging code into master
### Easier to roll back and pinpoint specific changes

## The Bad (maybe)
### No wider context
### Slow build process

## Example
### Service, Controller multiple PRs

## How?
Questions to ask yourself before submitting a PR.

## Final thoughts

One last time: keep those PRs small!

Thanks for reading.
