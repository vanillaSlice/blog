*tl;dr: I believe keeping your pull requests small will lead to quicker and better quality reviews allowing you to
merge your glorious code into master much sooner.*

*Disclaimer: Many of the behaviours described in this post have been exhibited by myself. I am not directing criticisms
at anyone in particular.*

## Storytime

Picture this. You've just arrived at work. It's a beautiful day, the sun is shining (not that you'll be seeing any of it
you hermit you ðŸ˜‰). You're raring to code. You switch on your laptop and grab a cup of coffee. You reply to a few emails
and see that you, yes you, have been hand-selected to review a pull request. Positively flattered, you open it only to
be hit by a wall of red and green. You think, "what is this Lovecraftian-sized beast that stands before me?". A
changeset so big that you could develop RSI just by scrolling through it. Lucky for you there are multiple reviewers.
Maybe a more seasoned veteran could cast an experienced eye over this game-changer. So you close the tab and forget about
it.

You've been sucked right back in. There's no escaping this now.

Headphones? Check. More coffee? Check.

You open the PR again.

As you scroll through the changes you realise that despite what the description says, this PR doesn't just add a new
feature. There are refactorings, renamings, deleted files, reformattings, import reorderings and, finally, new code.
And not just new code. A *lot* of new code. New code that could have been submitted independently in bite-sized
chunks.

You spend the next 45 minutes going over the changes, trying to understand how all of this works. You leave a few
suggestions. There's a bit of back and forth. The code generally looks pretty good. And with that, you bestow on the author
the honour of a pull request approval. You have done your good deed for the day. You're free at last! ![Party Parrot](/images/keep-those-prs-small/parrot.gif)

You take a look at this new PR. It's a fraction of the size of the previous one. It's to the point. It's a bug fix and *only*
a bug fix. Nothing more. Nothing less. You see what the problem originally was and how this PR fixes it. But you are
disappointed. Disappointed that you didn't spot this problem when reviewing the earlier PR. Once again, you approve.

Of course, there is rarely just one bug.

And so on and so on.

Now this may be slightly exaggerated but I'm sure most of you have been in similar situations (having been both characters).
I'm using this as a way to illustrate why I believe that keeping your PRs small will lead to quicker and better quality reviews.

## So what is a "Small PR"?

For me, pull requests should do one thing. Let me steal the advice in [Clean Code](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882)
on functions:

> Pull requests should do one thing. They should do it well. They should do it only.

Every line in your PR should contribute to that one thing. Anything that does not contribute to that one thing should be put
on a separate PR.

* Mixing bug fixes and new features? Put them on separate PRs.
* Moving those classes that we aren't using to a new package? Put them on a separate PR.
* Those refactorings that have no relevance to this new feature? Put them on a separate PR.
* Deleting old files that haven't been needed for the past 3 years? Put it on a separate PR.
* Writing two services that are completely independent of each other? Put them on separate PRs.

Choosing to do one thing in your PRs will naturally make them more focused and smaller (and reviewers will love you for it!).

## Advantages

So why on earth should we go to the effort of making smaller PRs? Here are some advantages I've observed:

### More likely to review
### Quicker reviews/More digestible
### Easier to spot problems
### Constantly merging code into master

## Disadvantages
### No wider context
### Slow build process

## Example
### Service, Controller multiple PRs

## Final thoughts

One last time: keep those PRs small!

Thanks for reading.
